# ChurnPrediction

## Key Features:
1. **Customer Data Upload**
   - Allow users to upload customer datasets (e.g., in CSV or Excel formats).

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and preprocess the uploaded data for analysis.
   - Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical values.

3. **Churn Prediction**
   - Implement a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Neural Networks) to predict customer churn based on features like call duration, payment history, etc.

4. **Visualization Dashboard**
   - Display insights using charts (e.g., churn rates, most influential factors in churn, etc.).

5. **Actionable Insights**
   - Suggest retention strategies based on predicted churn factors (e.g., discounts for high-value customers, better network quality for users with low usage).

6. **User Management**
   - Admin login to manage customer datasets and access the churn reports.

7. **Export Reports**
   - Export churn predictions and insights as downloadable PDF or Excel reports.
